    Decorator for Django views that sends returned dict to render_to_response
    function with given template and RequestContext as context instance.

    If view doesn't return dict then decorator simply returns output.
    Additionally view can return two-tuple, which must contain dict as first
    element and string with template name as second. This string will
    override template name, given as parameter

    Parameters:

     - template: template name to use
